# Awesome-Scientific-Research-Figures
A curated collection of high-quality figures from scientific research papers, including introduction diagrams, method/framework overviews, and experiment visualizations.
This repository aims to provide inspiration and reference for researchers, students, and practitioners when designing scientific figures for their own publications.

## Contents

The repository is organized into three primary categories:

### 1. `introduction/`

Figures that introduce a research problem, illustrate motivation, or describe high-level concepts.
Typical examples include:

* Problem definitions
* Motivation examples
* Task setups
* Overall conceptual illustrations

### 2. `framework/`

Figures that present the core methodology or system architecture.
Typical examples include:

* Framework diagrams
* Network architectures
* Processing pipelines
* Multi-stage or multi-module overviews

### 3. `experiments/`

Figures associated with empirical evaluation.
Typical examples include:

* Quantitative comparison charts
* Qualitative visualization results
* Ablation study diagrams
* Case studies and visual outputs

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. If you would like to add new figures:

1. Make sure the figure originates from a publicly available research paper.
2. Categorize it under the appropriate folder (introduction / framework / experiments).
3. Include the source information in a metadata file or as part of the pull request.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended **for educational and research purposes only**.
All figures belong to their respective authors and publications.
